#
# Colon (colon): Colons should be next to the identifier when specifying a type.
# Comma Spacing (comma): One space before and no after must be present next to any comma.
# Control Statement (control_statement): if,for,while,do statements shouldn't wrap their conditionals in parentheses.
# Force Cast (force_cast): Force casts should be avoided.
# Force Try (force_try): Force tries should be avoided.
# Leading Whitespace (leading_whitespace): Files should not contain leading whitespace.
# Nesting (nesting): Types should be nested at most 1 level deep, and statements should be nested at most 5 levels deep.
# Opening Brace Spacing (opening_brace): Opening braces should be preceded by a single space and on the same line as the declaration.
# Operator Function Whitespace (operator_whitespace): Operators should be surrounded by a single whitespace when defining them.
# Returning Whitespace (return_arrow_whitespace): Return arrow and return type should be separated by a single space or on a separate line.
# Statement Position (statement_position): Else and catch should be on the same line, one space after the previous declaration.
# Todo (todo): TODOs and FIXMEs should be avoided.

# Trailing Semicolon (trailing_semicolon): Lines should not have trailing semicolons.
# Trailing Whitespace (trailing_whitespace): Lines should not have trailing whitespace.
# Type Name (type_name): Type name should only contain alphanumeric characters, start with an uppercase character and span between 3 and 40 characters in length.
# Variable Name (variable_name): Variable name should only contain alphanumeric characters and start with a a lowercase character. In an exception to the above, variable names may start with a capital letter when they are declared static and immutable.
# File Line Length (file_length): Files should not span too many lines.
# Function Body Length (function_body_length): Functions bodies should not span too many lines.
# Line Length (line_length): Lines should not span too many characters.
# Type Body Length (type_body_length): Type bodies should not span too many lines.
# Variable Name Max Length Rule (variable_name_max_length): Variable name should not be too long.
# Variable Name Min Length Rule (variable_name_min_length): Variable name should not be too short.
